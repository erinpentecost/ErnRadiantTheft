# ErnRadiantTheft

Unlimited heists from the Thieves Guild.

There are unlimited marks to fleece out there in Tamriel. Talk to any Mastermind in the Thieves Guild after getting to Wet Ear rank, and you'll be able to take on heists. Heists will take you all across Tamriel (compatible with all landmass mods) as you attempt to steal valuable artifacts, incriminating letters, skooma, and more. Get the goods without being detected to get a hefty payout when you return to any Mastermind with your loot.
